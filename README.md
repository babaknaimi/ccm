# climetrics: an R package to quantify climate change metrics


climetrics is an extensible and reproducible R package to explore and spatially quantify  multiple dimensions of climate change. Six widely used metrics of climate change are implemented in the package including:

1) Standardized local anomalies (sed);
2) Changes in probability of local climate extremes (localExtreme);
3) Change in area of analogous climates (aaClimate);
4) Novel climates (novelClimate); 
5) Change in the distance to analogous climates (daClimate), 
6) Climate Change Velocity (ve; dVelocity; gVelocity).
