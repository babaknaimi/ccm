\title{Gradient-based Velocity of Climate Change}

\usage{
  gVelocity(x,...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{a Raster object or a Raster Time Series of climate variable}
  
  \item{...}{additional arguments; not implemented}
}

\description{
The method is developed based on Burrow et al. (2011) which is a gradient-based velocity of climate change. Climate velocity can inform conservation planning and action in a warming world.

Distance-based velocity is also implemented in the package and is available through the ccm function.
